I am a fast learner tho.

### 👀 About Me

I'm currently learing how to be a front-end developer. My journey began with not knowing what to do, and stumbeling across this study 'FDND' not knowing I was going to love it. Also if I am not coding or studying I am probably gaming or playing with my dog. Currently playing Black Ops 6
