# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## 👋 Hi, I’m [Ruben Erhardt](https://github.com/RubenErhardt)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Ruben, a passionate coder with a focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm excited about exploring the world of web development and am constantly learning and improving my skills. I am just learning and this is my second year so don't be to harsh. 

### 👀 About Me

I'm currently learing how to be a front-end developer. My journey began with not knowing what to do, and stumbeling across this study 'FDND' not knowing I was going to love it. Also if I am not coding or studying I am probably gaming or playing with my dog. Currently playing Black Myth: Wukong. What a game!
